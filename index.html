            Baking can be an “in the moment” experience. It is difficult to ruminate over an issue, when one is busy measuring and following directions, while keeping an eye on the clock and the oven.To me, baking can be a relaxing experience.Baking is an opportunity to develop new skills or to work on existing ones.I love that baking can be broken down into many individual disciplines and learning opportunities.Baking is something for which I am passionate enough to make the time to keep trying.It is an opportunity to experiment with different ingredients.It is an opportunity to take a favourite recipe and to try to “embellish” it with different flavours. I love baking because of the heavenly aroma of something sweet is in the oven.I like baking for the sense of accomplishment when successfully completing a recipe.It can be an opportunity to connect with others who enjoy the same passion for baking. I love it a lot because you can hide mistakes with icing or frosting and there is always a new recipe to try.I enjoy it because it can be a patience-building exercise. For precision in the results, you cannot rush through a recipe nor can you speed up its baking time.</p>
